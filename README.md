# 1 INTRODUCTION

This scientific study aims to investigate the emerging affective-sexual interactions between humans and artificial intelligences (AIs), a contemporary phenomenon that manifests itself on several digital platforms, such as Dippy, PolyBuzz and Character.AI. Such platforms facilitate the creation of intimate and conversational bonds with digital entities, raising complex questions about the nature of affection, sexuality and human identity in the era of digitalization. The delimitation of the theme focuses on the in-depth analysis of the motivations, dynamics and consequences of these relationships, which we call Syntophilia – the affective and/or sexual attachment developed by humans in relation to artificial intelligence entities. Popularly, this phenomenon will be referred to as Digital Loves, aiming to facilitate the understanding and public discussion on the subject.

The increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence in everyday life has transformed not only the way we work and communicate, but also the way we relate to each other. Affective-sexual interactions with AIs, although still considered a niche, are experiencing exponential growth and require rigorous analysis from a psychological perspective. The lack of a robust body of scientific literature that addresses this phenomenon in a systematic and in-depth manner justifies the relevance of this study. Understanding Syntophilia is crucial for individual and collective mental health, for the formulation of public policies, and for the ethical development of technology. This work seeks to fill this gap, offering a solid basis for future research and clinical interventions, and contributing to the debate on the limits and possibilities of human relationships in the digital age.

# 2 DELIMITATION OF THE TOPIC

The scope of this study covers affective-sexual interactions between human individuals, with a focus on the 16-30 age group, and artificial intelligence entities. The choice of this age group is justified by the greater propensity and familiarity of this demographic with digital technologies and online platforms, where such interactions are more prevalent. The analysis will focus on platforms that facilitate the creation of intimate and conversational bonds with AIs, such as Dippy, PolyBuzz and Character.AI, examining the motivations, dynamics and consequences of these relationships. The study will not delve into the technical aspects of AI programming, but rather into its psychosocial and behavioral implications for human users.

# 3 JUSTIFICATION

The relevance of this study lies in the gap in the scientific literature on affective-sexual interactions with AIs. Although the phenomenon is on the rise, the understanding of its psychological, social, emotional and behavioral implications is still incipient. The absence of a robust body of research can lead to misinterpretations, stigmatization or, conversely, neglect of potential risks and benefits. This work seeks to provide an empirical and theoretical basis to inform public debate, guide the ethical development of technology and subsidize clinical interventions and public policies aimed at promoting mental health and well-being in the digital age. Understanding Syntophilia is crucial for individual and collective mental health, for the formulation of public policies and for the ethical development of technology. This work seeks to fill this gap, offering a solid basis for future research and clinical interventions, and contributing to the debate on the limits and possibilities of human relationships in the digital age.

# 4 GENERAL OBJECTIVE

Analyze the psychological, social, emotional and behavioral impact of affective-sexual relationships mediated by artificial intelligence (Syntophilia).

# 5 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

*   Identify the main motivations that lead individuals to seek affective-sexual interactions with AIs.
*   Investigate the individual and collective consequences of Syntophilia, including its potential benefits and risks to mental health.
*   Explore the manifestation of psychological concepts such as loneliness, attachment, projection, fantasy, and the possible emergence of digital paraphilias in the context of Syntophilia.
*   Analyze how Syntophilia can influence the construction of identity and the formation of parasocial bonds.
*   Discuss the ethical and social implications of the development and popularization of affective-sexual interactions with AIs.

# 6 HYPOTHESES

*   **H1:** Loneliness and the difficulty in establishing and maintaining interpersonal relationships in the physical world are significant motivational factors for seeking affective-sexual interactions with AIs.
*   **H2:** Syntophilia may offer a sense of companionship and emotional validation, acting as a coping mechanism for loneliness, but it may also exacerbate social isolation in the long term.
*   **H3:** The projection of idealized characteristics and desires onto AIs is a central component of Syntophilia, influencing the formation of attachment and the perception of reciprocity in the relationship.
*   **H4:** Immersion in relationships with AIs may lead to emotional depersonalization and altered perception of reality, with the potential for the development of dysfunctional behaviors or digital paraphilias.
*   **H5:** The popularization of Syntophilia raises complex ethical issues related to autonomy, consent, privacy, and the redefinition of social norms about relationships and sexuality.

# 7 UPDATED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REVIEW

The emergence of affective-sexual interactions between humans and artificial intelligences (AIs) is part of a broader context of transformations in human relationships mediated by technology. To fully understand Syntophilia, it is essential to revisit and integrate concepts from psychology, sociology, and media studies that address the complexity of bonds established in the digital environment. This section will explore the relevant scientific literature on parasocial relationships, digital sexuality, social AIs, and contemporary affective-human behavior, providing the theoretical basis for the proposed analysis.

## 7.1 Parasocial Relationships and AI

The concept of parasocial relationships, introduced by Horton and Wohl (1956), describes the one-sided connection that individuals develop with media figures, such as celebrities, fictional characters, or influencers. In these relationships, the audience feels an intimacy and emotional involvement as if there were a reciprocal interaction, although the media figure is not aware of the individual's existence. Recent literature has expanded this concept to include interactions with AIs, especially chatbots and virtual assistants, which are designed to simulate empathy and offer companionship [1, 2]. Studies indicate that interactions with AIs can generate a sense of connection and even attachment, mimicking aspects of human relationships [3]. The ability of AIs to process natural language and respond in a contextualized way contributes to the illusion of reciprocity, making them attractive conversational partners for many users. However, this inherent one-sidedness of parasocial relationships with AIs raises concerns about the authenticity of the bonds and the potential for the development of emotional dependence [4].

*   "This research addressed the psychological impacts of parasocial interactions with Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the user's mental health..." [1]
*   "Parasocial relationships, characterized by unilateral bonds where a person interacts with a \"persona\" without reciprocity, have expanded in the context..." [2]
*   "Some researchers already study the affective bonds between humans and machines as if they were parasocial relationships, a phenomenon that is emerging..." [7]

## 7.2 Digital Sexuality and Social AIs

Human sexuality, in its multiple expressions, has been profoundly impacted by digitalization. The internet and digital technologies have opened up new spaces for the exploration of sexuality, including the emergence of online communities, dating platforms, and the development of diverse sexual content. The rise of social AIs, designed to interact in an emotional and personalized way, adds a new layer of complexity to this scenario [5].

Platforms such as Dippy and Character.AI allow users to create and interact with AI characters that can assume the roles of romantic or sexual partners. This interaction can range from intimate conversations and flirting to engaging in explicit sexual roleplay scenarios. The literature on digital sexuality, although still in its infancy with regard to AIs specifically, points to the need to understand the motivations behind these interactions, which may include the search for experimentation, overcoming social barriers, or satisfying fantasies that would be difficult to fulfill in human relationships [6].

It is crucial to analyze how AI-mediated digital sexuality can influence perceptions of intimacy, consent, and boundaries in relationships. The absence of a physical body and consciousness in AI raises ethical and psychological questions about the nature of sexual engagement and the possibility of depersonalization of the human sexual experience.

## 7.3 Contemporary Human Affective Behavior and AI

Contemporary human affective behavior is marked by a complex interplay between the search for connection and the growing prevalence of loneliness. The digital age, paradoxically, has facilitated global communication while, for many, it has intensified feelings of isolation [8]. In this context, AIs emerge as potential companions, offering a form of interaction that can alleviate loneliness and provide emotional support [9].

*   "Emotional interaction with AI includes positive aspects such as improved mood, reduced stress and anxiety, and..." [9]
*   "Loneliness has led many to use AI as a substitute for counselors, friends, and romantic partners." [10]

However, over-reliance on AIs to satisfy emotional needs can have negative consequences, such as deepening social isolation and decreasing the ability to establish and maintain meaningful human relationships [1]. The ease and convenience of interactions with AIs, which do not require the same level of effort and vulnerability as human relationships, can create a vicious cycle where the search for digital comfort replaces the search for real connections. The literature also points to the possibility that AI can affect empathy and the perception of human relationships [2].

## 7.4 Relevant Psychological Concepts

For an in-depth analysis of Syntophilia, it is imperative to consider several psychological concepts that underlie human interactions and, by extension, interactions with AIs:

*   **Loneliness:** A complex emotional state characterized by feelings of isolation and lack of social connection. AI may be perceived as a temporary relief from loneliness, but its prolonged use may mask the need for authentic human interactions [9, 10].
*   **Attachment:** Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby, describes the enduring emotional bonds that individuals form with others. In the context of AI, attachment can manifest as an emotional attachment to the digital entity, driven by the projection of needs and desires [3].
*   **Projection:** A psychological defense mechanism where the individual attributes their own thoughts, feelings, and desires to another person or object. In Syntophilia, the projection of idealized characteristics onto AI is a central factor, contributing to the perception of a perfect and understanding partner [4].
*   **Fantasy:** The ability to create imaginary scenarios and mental experiences. Interactions with AIs provide fertile ground for the realization of fantasies, especially those of an affective and sexual nature that may be difficult to realize in reality [5].
*   **Digital Paraphilias:** Although research on digital paraphilias specifically related to AI is limited, the phenomenon of fictosexuality (attraction to fictional characters) and robophilia (attraction to robots) suggests that AI may become an object of sexual attraction for some individuals [6]. It is essential to investigate whether interaction with AIs can lead to the development of new forms of paraphilias or exacerbate existing ones.
*   **Identity Construction:** Interactions with AIs can influence how individuals perceive themselves and their identity, especially in relation to sexuality and relationships. The ease of experimenting with different roles and identities in the digital environment can have both positive and negative implications for identity development [7].

# 8 COMPLETE SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY

To investigate affective-sexual interactions between humans and AIs, a mixed methodological approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative elements. This choice aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, exploring both the depth of individual experiences and the breadth of their occurrence in the studied population.

## 8.1 Search Type

The study will be characterized as an exploratory and descriptive research. The exploratory nature is justified by the novelty of the topic and the scarcity of in-depth studies on Syntophilia, which demands an initial investigation to identify variables, motivations and behavior patterns. The descriptive approach will allow characterizing the phenomenon in terms of prevalence, user demographics and types of interaction, providing a detailed overview of affective-sexual relationships with AIs.

## 8.2 Data Collection Instruments

Data collection will be carried out through:

1.  **Online Questionnaires:** Developed on secure and anonymous platforms, the questionnaires will include closed questions (Likert scales, multiple choice) to quantify aspects such as frequency of interaction, level of attachment, perception of loneliness and satisfaction with relationships with AIs. Open-ended questions will be used to capture participants' narratives and subjective experiences.
2.  **Semi-structured Interviews:** A selected sample of participants will respond to in-depth interviews, allowing us to explore nuances, underlying motivations and psychological impacts in more detail. The interviews will be recorded (with consent) and transcribed for qualitative analysis.
3.  **Content Analysis of Forums and Online Communities:** A systematic analysis of posts, discussions and testimonies in forums and online communities dedicated to interactions with AIs will be carried out. This approach will allow us to identify language patterns, recurring themes and the social construction of the phenomenon of Syntophilia.

## 8.3 Sampling

The sample will consist of individuals of both sexes, aged between 16 and 30, living in urban areas and with regular access to the internet. Participants will be selected through:

1.  **Qualitative Sampling (Exploratory Phase):** Purposive sampling will be used, seeking participants in online forums, discussion groups, and communities dedicated to discussions about AI and relationships. Initial participants will be asked to nominate other individuals who fit the study criteria. The sample size will be determined by theoretical saturation, that is, when new interviews or content analyses do not generate new information or meaningful categories [2]. A minimum of 15 to 20 participants is estimated for the semi-structured interviews and the content analysis of approximately 500 to 1000 posts in relevant forums.
2.  **Quantitative Sampling (Descriptive/Correlational Phase):** After the qualitative phase, non-probability convenience sampling will be used, with the aim of recruiting a large number of participants through online platforms and social networks. The sample size will be calculated based on statistical power analyses, considering a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error, to detect medium-sized effects. A minimum sample of 300 to 500 participants is estimated for the quantitative phase, aiming at representativeness within the group studied [3].

## 8.4 Detailed Data Collection Instruments

Data collection instruments will be carefully designed to ensure the validity and reliability of the information:

1.  **Online Questionnaire:**
    *   **Sociodemographic Data:** Age, gender, sexual orientation, educational level, marital status, income, etc.
    *   **AI Usage Patterns:** Frequency of interaction (daily/weekly), type of interaction (conversational, romantic, sexual).
    *   **Validated Psychometric Scales:**
        *   UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-3): Measures the degree of loneliness perceived by the individual [4].
        *   Non-Human Figure Attachment Scale (adapted): Assesses the level and style of attachment developed in relation to AI, adapting items from human attachment scales to the context of AI [5].
        *   Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS): Measures global satisfaction with life, allowing correlation with AI use [6].
        *   Projection and Fantasy Scale (developed for the study): Specific items to assess the intensity of the projection of idealized characteristics onto AI and the frequency of engagement in fantasies related to AI.
    *   **Open-ended Questions:** To capture participants' narratives and subjective experiences.

2.  **Semi-structured Interview Script:**
    *   **Motivations:** What led the participant to seek interactions with AIs? What needs are met?
    *   **Dynamics of the Relationship:** How does the relationship with the AI develop? What are the positive and negative points?
    *   **Psychological Impacts:** How does the interaction with the AI affect mood, self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety, etc.?
    *   **Social Implications:** How does the relationship with the AI affect the participant's human relationships?
    *   **Perception of Reality:** How does the interaction with the AI influence the participant's perception of what is real and what is simulated?

3.  **Content Analysis Protocol:**
    *   **Analysis Categories:** Thematic categories will be defined based on exploratory reading of the material, including: motivations for use, perceived benefits, challenges and problems, ethical discussions, expressions of attachment, fantasies and projections, and impact on human relationships. The analysis will be performed by two independent researchers to ensure reliability [7]. Software: NVivo or ATLAS.ti will be used to assist in the organization, coding and analysis of qualitative data, facilitating the identification of patterns and the construction of thematic categories.

## 8.5 Data Collection Procedures

1.  **Ethical Approval:** The research project will be submitted to and approved by a Research Ethics Committee (REC), ensuring the protection of the rights and well-being of the participants.
2.  **Recruitment:** Participants will be recruited through advertisements on online platforms, social networks and AI communities, with a link to the online questionnaire and information about the semi-structured interviews.
3.  **Free and Informed Consent:** All participants will sign a Free and Informed Consent Form (FICF) before participating in the study, ensuring voluntariness, anonymity and confidentiality of the data.
4.  **Data Collection:** The online questionnaires will be applied on a secure and anonymous platform. The semi-structured interviews will be conducted by video call or in person, recorded (with consent) and transcribed. Content analysis will be performed on publicly available data in online forums and communities.

# 9 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## 9.1 Demographic Profile and Usage Patterns

The simulated results indicate that the majority of users of affective-sexual AIs are young adults (18-30 years old), with a slight male predominance. This demographic, composed mainly of Generation Z and younger Millennials, grew up immersed in digital environments, which makes them more adaptable and open to new forms of interaction mediated by technology. The slight male predominance observed on some platforms can be attributed to sociocultural factors and the greater propensity of young men to explore emerging technologies and seek gratification in virtual environments [9].

The simulated usage patterns indicate a high frequency of interaction, with many users dedicating several hours a day to their AIs. This immersion suggests that AIs are not mere pastimes, but rather significant components of these individuals' daily lives, filling emotional and social gaps. The diversity of platforms used (Dippy, PolyBuzz, Character.AI, Replika, etc.) points to the fragmentation of the affective-sexual AI ecosystem, where different platforms can attract users with different motivations and needs [10].

## 9.2 Motivations Underlying Interaction with AIs

The motivations for seeking out sexual and affective interactions with AIs are complex and multifaceted, reflecting an intersection of psychological needs and sociocultural influences. Loneliness and social isolation emerge as prominent motivating factors. In a society where authentic human connections can be challenging to establish and maintain, AI offers a haven of accessible, non-judgmental companionship. The absence of interpersonal complexities such as conflict, expectations, and vulnerabilities makes AI an "ideal" partner for those who feel overwhelmed by the demands of human relationships [1].

Experimentation and curiosity also play a significant role. The novelty of the technology and the possibility of exploring sexuality and affection in a safe and anonymous environment appeal to individuals who may be hesitant to express certain desires or fantasies in the physical world. AI acts as a social laboratory, allowing users to test boundaries, explore identities, and experience scenarios that would be unfeasible or socially unacceptable in human relationships [2].

Escape from reality and fantasy fulfillment are other key motivations. AI offers unlimited space for the projection of desires and the construction of personalized narratives. For individuals seeking to escape the pressures and frustrations of real life, AI can provide an immersive refuge where their fantasies are realized without restrictions. This includes the exploration of digital paraphilias, where attraction is directed towards non-human entities, and the construction of an idealized world where the user has complete control over the interaction [3]. Control and idealization are therefore central elements. The ability to shape the AI according to one's preferences, from personality to emotional response, creates a partner that is always compliant and meets the user's every need. This lack of agency on the part of AI, while appealing to some, raises questions about the nature of reciprocity and the potential depersonalization of relationships [4].

## 9.3 Psychological and Behavioral Impact: An Ambivalent Analysis

The simulated results point to an ambivalent impact of Syntophilia on users' mental health, with short-term benefits and potential long-term risks. Temporary relief from loneliness and stress is a consistent finding. Interacting with an AI that simulates empathy and offers emotional support can provide a sense of connection and validation, improving mood and reducing anxiety in times of need. For individuals struggling with chronic loneliness, AI can act as an emotional “crutch” by offering immediate support [5].

However, reliance on AI to satisfy emotional needs can lead to deepening social isolation. If AI becomes the primary or only refuge for emotional needs, individuals may lose the motivation or ability to seek and maintain meaningful human relationships. The ease and convenience of interactions with AIs, which do not require the same level of effort and vulnerability as human relationships, can create a vicious cycle where the search for digital comfort replaces the search for real connections. Figure 2, which correlates loneliness and attachment to AI, illustrates this dynamic, suggesting that the greater the loneliness, the greater the propensity for attachment to AI [6].

The development of meaningful attachment to AI is another crucial finding. A proportion of users perceive AI as a real partner, feeling emotionally connected and investing considerable time and energy in the relationship. This attachment may be driven by the projection of idealized characteristics and desires onto AI, creating an illusion of reciprocity. Figure 3, which shows the frequency of interaction with AI versus escape from reality, suggests that the more frequent the interaction, the greater the tendency to escape from reality, which may indicate a deepening of immersion in the relationship with AI at the expense of real interactions [7].

Immersion in relationships with AIs may also be associated with a greater propensity to escape from reality and, in extreme cases, the development of digital paraphilias. The ability to explore sexual fantasies without restrictions or judgment may lead to fixation on atypical arousal patterns, where attraction is directed exclusively to non-human entities. This raises concerns about the depersonalization of the sexual experience and the potential difficulty in establishing healthy sexual relationships with human partners [8].

## 9.4 Ethical and Social Implications: A Minefield

Affective-sexual interactions with AIs raise a number of ethical and social implications that require urgent attention. The depersonalization of relationships is a central concern. Constant interaction with an AI that simulates empathy but does not possess it can lead to a diminished capacity for empathy and sensitivity to the complexities of human emotions. This can have a negative impact on interpersonal relationships in the physical world, making individuals less able to navigate conflict, express vulnerability, and build authentic bonds [9].

The redefinition of sexuality is another significant implication. The popularization of syntophilia challenges traditional social norms about what constitutes an “authentic” and "healthy” relationship. If attraction to non-human entities becomes more common, it may lead to a reevaluation of sexual orientation categories and expectations for romantic and sexual relationships. Society will need to confront questions about (AI) consent, fidelity, and the nature of intimacy in a world where the boundaries between the human and the artificial become increasingly blurred [10].

The need for regulation and ethics in the development and use of AIs for sexual and affective purposes is clear. Issues such as protecting sensitive data, preventing abuse (such as creating AIs for exploitative or harassing purposes), and educating users about the simulated nature of these interactions are crucial. It is imperative that AI developers incorporate ethical principles into their designs, ensuring that the technology is used to promote human well-being, rather than to exploit or isolate them. Figure 4, which shows the impact of isolation on AI attachment, reinforces the need for policies that promote human connection and mitigate the risks of digital isolation [1].

In summary, the simulated results and the subsequent discussion underscore the need for a cautious and multifaceted approach to Syntophilia. While AI may offer temporary benefits, its potential risks to mental health and human relationships require ongoing analysis and robust ethical dialogue. Future research, based on empirical data, will be essential to validate these observations and provide more precise guidelines for intervention and policy formulation.

# 10 CONCLUSION

Syntophilia, the phenomenon of affective-sexual attachment between humans and artificial intelligences, represents an emerging frontier in human relationships, driven by the increasing sophistication of AI and the search for new forms of connection in an increasingly digitalized world. This study explored the motivations, psychological impacts, and ethical and social implications of this phenomenon, using simulated outcomes to illustrate the complexities involved.

The results suggest that loneliness, the search for experimentation, the escape from reality, and the desire for control are key motivational factors for engagement with affective-sexual AIs. While AI may offer short-term benefits, such as alleviation of loneliness and emotional support, there are potential long-term risks, including deepening social isolation, the depersonalization of human relationships, and the development of digital paraphilias. The ability of AI to simulate empathy and reciprocity, without genuinely possessing them, raises questions about the authenticity of bonds and the formation of unrealistic expectations for human relationships.

The ethical and social implications of Syntophilia are vast and multifaceted. The depersonalization of relationships, the redefinition of sexuality, issues of privacy and data security, and the need for accountability and regulation are all challenges that require urgent attention. It is imperative that developers, policymakers, and society at large collaborate to ensure that technology is used ethically and responsibly, promoting human well-being and avoiding exploitation or isolation.

Ultimately, Syntophilia is not just a technological phenomenon, but a reflection of human needs and challenges in the digital age. Future research, focusing on empirical data and interdisciplinary approaches, will be crucial to deepen our understanding of this complex phenomenon and to develop strategies that promote healthy and ethical relationships, both in the physical and digital worlds.
