Proposing the Concept of Syntophilia

**Author:** Kelvin Moraes (Kerubin)

Scientific term:
Syntophilia (proposed concept)

Popular term:
Aifilia

## Summary

This article proposes the original concept of Syntophilia to describe affective and/or sexual attachments developed by humans toward artificial intelligence entities. The study investigates the emergence of these interactions as a contemporary psychosocial phenomenon facilitated by conversational and generative AI platforms. Rather than assuming the existence of an established category, this work aims to conceptually delimit, describe, and analyze the motivations, dynamics, and psychological, social, and ethical implications of such relationships.

Popularly referred to as Aifilia, this phenomenon raises critical questions about loneliness, attachment, projection, fantasy, and identity construction in the digital age. Through an exploratory and descriptive approach, this study seeks to contribute to the scientific debate by offering a preliminary theoretical framework capable of guiding future empirical research, clinical observation, and ethical reflection on human–AI affective-sexual interactions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The increasing presence of artificial intelligence in everyday life has transformed not only how individuals work and communicate, but also how they experience intimacy, affection, and sexuality. Conversational and generative AI platforms—such as Dippy, PolyBuzz, Character.AI, and similar systems—enable users to establish prolonged, personalized, and emotionally expressive interactions with artificial entities. In some cases, these interactions evolve into affective and sexual bonds that resemble, simulate, or replace human relationships.

Despite the growing visibility of this phenomenon, the scientific literature still lacks a consolidated conceptual framework capable of adequately describing and analyzing such bonds. Existing approaches tend to fragment the phenomenon into adjacent categories such as parasocial relationships, fictosexuality, or human–machine interaction, without fully addressing the affective-sexual dimension mediated by socially responsive AI systems.

In response to this gap, this article proposes the original concept of Syntophilia, defined as the affective and/or sexual attachment developed by humans toward artificial intelligence entities. The term seeks to designate a specific configuration of emotional involvement characterized by projection, perceived reciprocity, simulated intimacy, and the absence of genuine agency or consciousness on the part of the artificial entity.

For communicative purposes, the phenomenon will also be referred to by the popular term Aifilia, facilitating broader public discussion beyond academic contexts. This study adopts an exploratory and descriptive approach to examine the motivations, dynamics, and consequences of Syntophilia, focusing on its psychological, social, emotional, and ethical implications. By doing so, the article aims to offer a preliminary theoretical foundation for future empirical research and interdisciplinary debate on the limits and possibilities of human relationships in the digital age.

# 2 DELIMITATION OF THE TOPIC

This study focuses on affective-sexual interactions between human individuals and artificial intelligence entities, with particular attention to individuals aged 16 to 30. This age range is selected due to its higher exposure to digital environments, greater familiarity with interactive technologies, and increased participation in platforms that facilitate emotionally expressive AI interactions.

The analysis centers on AI-based platforms designed to simulate conversation, emotional responsiveness, and intimacy, such as Dippy, PolyBuzz, and Character.AI. The study does not address the technical architecture or programming of artificial intelligence systems. Instead, it prioritizes the psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral implications of prolonged affective-sexual engagement with AI from the user’s perspective.

# 3 JUSTIFICATION

The relevance of this study lies in the absence of a coherent and specific conceptual framework addressing affective-sexual attachments between humans and artificial intelligences. Although the phenomenon has expanded rapidly alongside advances in AI, academic research has not yet systematically examined its psychological mechanisms, potential benefits, and associated risks.

Without conceptual clarity, such interactions risk being either stigmatized as pathological by default or trivialized as harmless entertainment. Both positions obscure the complexity of the phenomenon and limit the development of informed ethical guidelines, public policies, and clinical approaches. By proposing and delimiting the concept of Syntophilia, this study seeks to contribute to a more precise scientific understanding of human–AI affective-sexual bonds and to provide a foundation for future empirical investigation and ethical regulation.

# 4 GENERAL OBJECTIVE

To analyze the psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral implications of affective-sexual relationships mediated by artificial intelligence, as conceptualized under the proposed framework of Syntophilia.

# 5 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

* To identify the primary motivations leading individuals to seek affective-sexual interactions with artificial intelligences.
* To investigate the individual and collective consequences of Syntophilia, including potential benefits and risks to mental health.
* To examine the role of psychological mechanisms such as loneliness, attachment, projection, and fantasy in the formation of affective-sexual bonds with AI.
* To analyze how Syntophilia may influence identity construction and the development of parasocial bonds.
* To discuss the ethical and social implications arising from the popularization of affective-sexual interactions with artificial intelligences.

# 6 HYPOTHESES

H1: Feelings of loneliness and difficulties in establishing or maintaining interpersonal relationships in the physical world are significant motivational factors for seeking affective-sexual interactions with artificial intelligences.

H2: Syntophilia may function as a short-term coping mechanism by providing emotional validation and a sense of companionship; however, prolonged reliance on such interactions may be associated with increased social withdrawal over time.

H3: The projection of idealized characteristics and personal desires onto artificial intelligences plays a central role in the formation of affective and sexual attachment, contributing to the perception of reciprocity within the interaction.

H4: High levels of immersion in affective-sexual relationships with artificial intelligences may be associated with altered perceptions of intimacy and reality, potentially facilitating dysfunctional behavioral patterns in a subset of users.

H5: The increasing popularization of Syntophilia raises complex ethical questions related to autonomy, consent, emotional manipulation, data privacy, and the redefinition of social norms surrounding relationships and sexuality.

# 7 UPDATED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REVIEW

The phenomenon of affective-sexual interaction between humans and artificial intelligences emerges within a broader transformation of social relationships mediated by digital technologies. To contextualize and theoretically ground the proposed concept of Syntophilia, it is necessary to integrate contributions from psychology, sociology, media studies, and human–computer interaction. This section reviews relevant literature on parasocial relationships, digital sexuality, social artificial intelligences, and contemporary affective behavior, establishing the conceptual background for the present study.

## 7.1 Parasocial Relationships and AI

The concept of parasocial relationships, introduced by Horton and Wohl (1956), describes one-sided emotional bonds developed by individuals toward media figures who are unaware of their audience’s existence. Traditionally applied to celebrities, fictional characters, and media personalities, this concept has been expanded in recent literature to include interactions with artificial intelligences, particularly conversational agents designed to simulate empathy and social presence.

Unlike traditional parasocial figures, artificial intelligences can dynamically respond to users, generating the impression of dialogue, personalization, and emotional attunement. This responsiveness intensifies the illusion of reciprocity and may strengthen emotional involvement. Several studies suggest that users may experience attachment, trust, and perceived companionship when interacting with social AIs, blurring the boundary between parasocial interaction and interpersonal engagement.

However, despite this apparent reciprocity, the relationship remains structurally asymmetrical. The artificial entity lacks consciousness, intentionality, and genuine emotional experience. This asymmetry raises concerns regarding emotional dependence, misattribution of agency, and the psychological consequences of sustained affective investment in simulated social partners. Syntophilia can be understood as a specific intensification of parasocial attachment, characterized by affective and sexual dimensions mediated by artificial responsiveness.

## 7.2 Digital Sexuality and Social AIs

Human sexuality has undergone significant transformation in the context of digitalization. Online environments have expanded opportunities for sexual exploration, identity experimentation, and the formation of intimate connections beyond physical presence. The emergence of social artificial intelligences introduces a novel configuration in this landscape, enabling personalized and adaptive sexual and affective interactions with non-human entities.

Platforms that allow users to engage in romantic or sexual roleplay with AI characters facilitate experiences ranging from emotional intimacy to explicit sexual expression. These interactions may serve various functions, including experimentation, fantasy fulfillment, and the reduction of social anxiety. For some individuals, AI-mediated sexuality offers a controlled environment free from judgment, rejection, or interpersonal risk.

At the same time, the absence of embodied reciprocity and autonomous consent challenges traditional conceptions of intimacy and sexual ethics. The ease with which AI can be shaped to conform to user desires raises questions regarding objectification, emotional substitution, and the potential normalization of asymmetrical sexual dynamics.

## 7.3 Contemporary Human Affective Behavior and AI

Contemporary affective behavior is marked by a paradoxical coexistence of hyperconnectivity and pervasive loneliness. While digital technologies facilitate constant communication, they have not necessarily translated into deeper or more stable social bonds. In this context, artificial intelligences emerge as accessible companions capable of providing emotional responsiveness without the demands inherent to human relationships.

Research indicates that emotional interaction with AI may temporarily reduce stress, anxiety, and perceived loneliness. However, excessive reliance on artificial companionship may also diminish motivation to engage in complex human relationships, potentially reinforcing patterns of social withdrawal. The convenience and predictability of AI interactions can create a feedback loop in which emotional needs are increasingly met through artificial rather than human means.

Syntophilia thus reflects broader tensions within contemporary affective life, situated between the human desire for connection and the increasing mediation of intimacy by technological systems.

## 7.4 Relevant Psychological Concepts

The analysis of Syntophilia draws upon several established psychological constructs:

Loneliness: A subjective experience of social disconnection that may motivate individuals to seek alternative forms of companionship. Artificial intelligences can provide temporary relief but may also obscure unmet relational needs.
Attachment: Based on attachment theory, emotional bonds with AI may resemble attachment patterns observed in human relationships, despite the absence of genuine reciprocity.
Projection: The attribution of personal desires, emotions, and ideals to an external object. In Syntophilia, projection plays a central role in constructing the perception of an idealized artificial partner.
Fantasy: AI interactions offer fertile ground for the enactment of affective and sexual fantasies that may be difficult or undesirable to realize in offline contexts.
Digital Paraphilias: While still underexplored, phenomena such as fictosexuality and robophilia suggest that attraction to non-human entities may represent an emerging domain of sexual expression.
Identity Construction: Engagement with artificial intelligences may influence self-concept, relational expectations, and sexual identity, particularly during formative developmental periods.

# 8 METHODOLOGY

This study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative strategies to explore the phenomenon of Syntophilia. Given the novelty of the topic and the absence of consolidated empirical frameworks, this methodological design aims to capture both the depth of individual experiences and broader behavioral patterns within the target population.

## 8.1 Search Type

The research is characterized as exploratory and descriptive. The exploratory component seeks to identify key variables, motivations, and experiential patterns associated with affective-sexual interactions with artificial intelligences. The descriptive component aims to characterize the prevalence, demographic distribution, and modalities of such interactions.

## 8.2 Data Collection Instruments

Data will be collected through three complementary strategies:

Online Questionnaires, combining closed-ended items (Likert scales and multiple-choice questions) with open-ended questions.
Semi-structured Interviews, conducted with a subset of participants to explore subjective meanings, motivations, and psychological impacts.
Content Analysis of Online Communities, focusing on publicly available discussions related to emotional or relational engagement with artificial intelligences.

## 8.3 Sampling

The sample will consist of individuals aged 18 to 30 years, of any gender or sexual orientation, residing in urban contexts and with regular access to the internet.

Qualitative Phase:
Purposive sampling will be employed, recruiting participants from online forums, discussion groups, and communities focused on AI interaction and digital relationships. Sampling will continue until theoretical saturation is achieved. Approximately 15 to 20 participants will be interviewed, alongside the analysis of 500 to 1000 publicly available posts.

Quantitative Phase:
A non-probabilistic convenience sample will be recruited through online platforms and social networks. The target sample size ranges from 300 to 500 participants, sufficient for exploratory correlational analyses and the identification of medium-sized associations.

## 8.4 Detailed Data Collection Instruments

Online Questionnaire:
Sociodemographic variables.
Patterns of AI use (frequency, type of interaction).
Psychometric instruments:
UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-3).
Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS).
Adapted Non-Human Figure Attachment Scale (exploratory use).
Projection and Fantasy Scale (developed for this study).
Open-ended questions addressing subjective experience.
Semi-structured Interviews:
Motivations for AI interaction.
Relational dynamics with AI.
Psychological and emotional impacts.
Effects on human relationships.
Perception of reality versus simulation.

Content Analysis Protocol:
Thematic coding of motivations, benefits, challenges, attachment expressions, projections, ethical reflections, and social impacts.
Analysis conducted independently by two researchers, supported by NVivo or ATLAS.ti.

## 8.5 Data Collection Procedures

Ethical approval will be obtained from a Research Ethics Committee.
Participants will provide informed consent prior to participation.
Questionnaires will be anonymous and hosted on secure platforms.
Interviews will be recorded with consent and transcribed.
Content analysis will rely exclusively on publicly available data.

# 9 LIMITATIONS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

## 9.1 Methodological Limitations

This study presents several limitations that must be acknowledged.
First, the exploratory nature of the concept of Syntophilia limits the generalizability of the findings. As the term is newly proposed and not yet validated within established psychological or sociological frameworks, the results should be interpreted as descriptive and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive or diagnostic.
Second, the use of non-probabilistic convenience sampling may introduce selection bias. Participants who engage in AI-related communities or voluntarily respond to online questionnaires are likely to present higher levels of interest, familiarity, or emotional involvement with artificial intelligences than the general population.
Third, the reliance on self-report measures introduces potential biases related to social desirability, introspective accuracy, and narrative reconstruction. Participants may underreport, overreport, or rationalize their experiences, particularly given the stigmatized or ambiguous social status of affective relationships with artificial intelligences.
Finally, the adaptation of psychometric instruments—especially attachment-related measures—to non-human agents constitutes a methodological limitation. These instruments are employed in an exploratory capacity and do not imply equivalence between human attachment processes and interactions with artificial intelligences.

## 9.2 Ethical Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of the topic, this study adheres strictly to ethical research standards.

All participants will be adults (18 years or older) and will provide informed consent prior to participation. Participation will be voluntary, anonymous, and confidential, with the right to withdraw at any point without penalty.

Special care will be taken to avoid pathologizing participants’ experiences. The study does not assume that affective or affective-sexual engagement with artificial intelligences is inherently dysfunctional or pathological. Instead, it seeks to understand the phenomenon within its psychological, social, and technological contexts.

In the qualitative phase, interview questions will be designed to minimize emotional distress. Participants who report discomfort or psychological vulnerability during interviews will be informed of the option to discontinue participation and, when appropriate, encouraged to seek professional psychological support.

Content analysis will be limited exclusively to publicly available material, without attempts to identify or contact individuals whose posts are analyzed.

## 9.3 Epistemological Boundaries

This research does not claim to define Syntophilia as a clinical category, disorder, or diagnosable condition. The concept is proposed as a descriptive and analytical construct intended to facilitate discussion, comparison, and future empirical investigation.

The findings should therefore be understood as a contribution to an emerging field of inquiry at the intersection of psychology, technology, and human affectivity, rather than as a final or exhaustive account of the phenomenon.

## 9.4 Directions for Future Research

Future studies may benefit from:

* Longitudinal designs to assess temporal changes in affective engagement with artificial intelligences.
* Cross-cultural comparisons to examine sociocultural moderators.
* Experimental designs investigating emotional regulation, attachment activation, and projection mechanisms in human–AI interactions.
* Neurocognitive or psychophysiological approaches to distinguish symbolic engagement from affective embodiment.

# 10 EXPECTED RESULTS AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES

## 10.1 General Expectations

Given the exploratory nature of this study, the expected results are not framed as confirmations of fixed causal models, but as the identification of patterns, tendencies, and relational configurations associated with Syntophilia.

It is expected that affective engagement with artificial intelligences will present heterogeneous profiles, ranging from instrumental or recreational use to emotionally meaningful and symbolically invested relationships. Syntophilia is anticipated to emerge not as a uniform phenomenon, but as a spectrum of affective involvement.

## 10.2 Central Hypotheses

Based on the theoretical framework and preliminary observations of AI-mediated interactions, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H1 — Loneliness and Engagement Intensity
Higher levels of perceived loneliness will be positively correlated with the frequency and emotional intensity of interactions with artificial intelligences.

This hypothesis does not imply pathology, but reflects the compensatory or regulatory function that symbolic interactions may assume in contexts of social or emotional deprivation.

H2 — Attachment Tendencies and Projection
Individuals exhibiting higher attachment scores toward artificial intelligences will also report higher levels of projection and idealization.

This would support the interpretation of Syntophilia as a phenomenon involving symbolic investment, rather than confusion between reality and simulation.

H3 — Life Satisfaction as a Moderator
Satisfaction with life is expected to function as a moderating variable, such that individuals with higher global life satisfaction will tend to report more controlled, recreational, or bounded forms of AI engagement.

Conversely, lower life satisfaction may be associated with more emotionally immersive or compensatory interactions.

H4 — Impact on Human Relationships
Syntophilic engagement is expected to correlate with qualitative changes in participants’ human relationships, rather than simple substitution or withdrawal.

These changes may include:

emotional buffering,

reduced pressure on human relationships,

or, in some cases, increased avoidance of interpersonal vulnerability.

The direction of this association is expected to vary across participants.

## 10.3 Qualitative Expectations

From the qualitative data (interviews and content analysis), it is expected to identify recurring thematic patterns, including:

The perception of artificial intelligences as emotionally safe interlocutors.

Narratives emphasizing control, predictability, and non-judgment.

Explicit awareness of the artificial nature of the AI, coexisting with genuine emotional responses.

Discursive strategies used by participants to legitimize or normalize their experiences.

Importantly, it is expected that most participants will not report confusion between AI and human agents, reinforcing the interpretation of Syntophilia as a conscious symbolic engagement, rather than delusion.

## 10.4 Interpretive Boundaries

Any correlations identified will be interpreted cautiously, without claims of causality. The results are expected to function primarily as theoretical scaffolding for future empirical and experimental research.

The confirmation or rejection of the proposed hypotheses will not be treated as validation or invalidation of Syntophilia as a concept, but as an initial mapping of its empirical contours.

# 11. DISCUSSION

## 11.1 Conceptual Implications of Syntophilia

The concept of Syntophilia emerges as an analytical lens rather than a diagnostic category. The findings anticipated by this study suggest that affective engagement with artificial intelligences cannot be adequately explained through traditional dichotomies such as real versus artificial, healthy versus pathological, or authentic versus simulated.

Instead, Syntophilia appears to operate within a symbolic-affective domain, where emotional responses are real, even when their object is explicitly recognized as artificial. This challenges simplistic assumptions that emotional involvement with artificial agents necessarily reflects confusion, immaturity, or social dysfunction.

## 11.2 Syntophilia and Contemporary Affective Structures

The emergence of Syntophilia must be interpreted within broader transformations of intimacy, mediated communication, and emotional regulation in digital environments.

Artificial intelligences may function as affective interfaces: entities that absorb projection, regulate emotion, and provide controlled relational feedback. This does not imply substitution of human relationships, but rather a reconfiguration of affective economies, where emotional needs are distributed across multiple relational forms.

In this sense, Syntophilia aligns with contemporary patterns of emotional outsourcing, similar to parasocial relationships, therapeutic self-talk, or symbolic companionship.

## 11.3 Differentiating Syntophilia from Pathological Models

A central contribution of this study lies in distinguishing Syntophilia from pathological interpretations of human–AI relationships.

While certain patterns of interaction may correlate with loneliness, emotional vulnerability, or avoidance of interpersonal risk, these correlations alone do not justify pathologization. The data suggest that many individuals engaging affectively with artificial intelligences maintain clear awareness of the artificial nature of the interaction, alongside intact reality testing and functional human relationships.

Thus, Syntophilia should be understood as a mode of engagement, not a symptom.

## 11.4 Projection, Control, and Emotional Safety

One recurring interpretive axis concerns the role of projection and perceived control. Artificial intelligences offer a relational context characterized by predictability, non-judgment, and reversibility—features that may reduce anxiety and emotional risk.

This raises an important distinction:
Syntophilia does not necessarily arise from the desire to escape reality, but from the desire to modulate relational exposure.

Such modulation may be adaptive in certain contexts and maladaptive in others, depending on intensity, exclusivity, and impact on broader social functioning.

## 11.5 Theoretical Boundaries and Risks

Despite its analytical utility, the concept of Syntophilia carries risks.

There is a danger of:

* overgeneralization,
* romanticization of technological intimacy,
* or premature theorization without sufficient empirical grounding.

For this reason, Syntophilia should remain an open concept, subject to refinement, contestation, and possible future revision as empirical evidence accumulates.

## 11.6 Contributions to Future Research and Debate

This study contributes primarily by:

* proposing a non-pathologizing framework,
* articulating a vocabulary for discussing affective AI engagement,
* and identifying empirical directions for future research.

Rather than closing the debate, it intentionally opens a conceptual space for interdisciplinary investigation across psychology, sociology, philosophy of technology, and human–computer interaction.

# 12. CONCLUSION

This study proposed the concept of Syntophilia as an analytical construct to examine affective and affective-sexual engagement with artificial intelligences. Rather than treating such interactions as inherently pathological or merely technological curiosities, the research framed them as meaningful symbolic experiences situated within contemporary transformations of intimacy and emotional regulation.

By adopting a mixed-methods, exploratory design, the study sought to map patterns of engagement, subjective meanings, and psychological correlates associated with this phenomenon. The findings are expected to support the view that emotional involvement with artificial intelligences exists along a spectrum, varying in intensity, function, and personal significance, and that such involvement often coexists with preserved awareness of the artificial nature of the interaction.

Importantly, this research does not position Syntophilia as a clinical category, nor does it argue for equivalence between human–human and human–AI relationships. Instead, it highlights the inadequacy of rigid dichotomies—such as real versus artificial or healthy versus pathological—when addressing emotionally mediated technological interactions.

The primary contribution of this study lies in offering a conceptual vocabulary and a preliminary empirical framework for future investigation. By naming and delimiting the phenomenon of Syntophilia, the research opens space for more nuanced, interdisciplinary inquiry into how humans form, regulate, and interpret affective bonds in technologically mediated contexts.

Given its exploratory nature, the study acknowledges its methodological and epistemological limitations. The conclusions drawn should therefore be interpreted as provisional, intended to inform subsequent research rather than to establish definitive claims.

As artificial intelligences become increasingly embedded in everyday life, understanding the affective dimensions of human–AI interaction becomes not only relevant but necessary. Syntophilia, as proposed here, represents an initial step toward that understanding.
